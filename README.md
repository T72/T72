- 👋 Hi, I’m @T72
- 👀 I’m interested in using scripts for boring, time-consuming and tedious repetitive tasks .. apart from programming I am passionate about electronic music production, synths, drum machines, samplers and such ..
- :bulb: I am fascinated by the new opportunities that are introduced to the availability of large language models and their rapidly growing capabilities! I am currently looking into developing LLM applications for several useful use cases - one at a time :rocket: A major goal is to contribute to the field of requirements engineering, taking initial steps toward creating an AI assistant to support a team of requirements engineers. This tool is in its early stages of development and is intended to incrementally aid requirements engineers with their work. :gear: My approach is to build each assistant from the ground up, thoughtfully adding features that address the real-world challenges these professionals face. Learning as I move forward!
- 🌱 I started learning Python in 2021/2022 and have some experience in embedded systems SW development, especially with C/C++, developing GUI's in Java with the Swing framework and a bit of web development with HTML and CSS or customizing WordPress with PHP and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects, if interesting enough to spend a chunk of my time on it regularly. Feel free to introduce me to your project in case you believe I might be a good fit to collaborate or join.
- 📫 How to reach me ... please write an e-mail to marcus.dindorf@gmail.com using [GITHUB] in the subject line. Thank you for your interest!
