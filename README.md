- 👋 Hi, I’m @T72
- 👀 I’m interested in using scripts for boring, time-consuming and tedious repetitive tasks .. apart from programming I am passionate about electronic music production, synths, drum machines, samplers and such ..
- :bulb: I am fascinated by the new opportunities that are introduced to the availability of large language models and their rapidly growing capabilities! I am currently looking into developing LLM applications for several useful use cases - one at a time
- :rocket: One idea is to contribute to the field of requirements engineering, taking initial steps toward creating an AI assistant to support a team of requirements engineers. However, to get my feet wet with full-stack web development, I first started the development of a React TypeScript web application that helps HR professionals and/or job seekers find matching roles/talents quickly for which the MVP is currently in early development.
- :gear: My development approach is hands-on building each solution from the ground up including testing, and thoughtfully adding features that address the real-world challenges of the target audience, one step at a time. Learning as I move forward!
- 🌱 I started learning Python in 2021/2022 and have some experience in embedded systems SW development, especially with C/C++, developing GUI's in Java with the Swing framework and a bit of web development with HTML and CSS or customizing WordPress with PHP and JavaScript. Since 2024, I have been using React with TypeScript and JavaScript delving into full-stack web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects, if interesting enough to spend a chunk of my time on it regularly. Feel free to introduce me to your project in case you believe I might be a good fit to collaborate or join.
- 📫 How to reach me ... please write an e-mail to marcus.dindorf@gmail.com using [GITHUB] in the subject line. Thank you for your interest!
